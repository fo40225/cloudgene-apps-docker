## mtDNA-Server

mtDNA-Server provides a free [service](http://mtdna-server.uibk.ac.at) for the analysis of human mitochondrial DNA data, currently focusing on reliable identification of heteroplasmy (>= 1%) and contamination. mtDNA-Server can be executed without any user login. We also provide post-processing guidelines that should be applied after each automated analysis.
